Rapunzel is a FastCGI library written in C++ using boost::asio and threads.

The design goal was being able to be used without using callback-based
programming on the user's end.

To facilitate this it uses boost::asio and threads to make read operations
non-blocking.

It's still not finished so don't use it to run your mega-bank or anything like
that.


Example program:

    #include "fcgi_connection_manager.h"
    int main() {
        fcgi::connection_manager fcgi;
        while(true) {
            fcgi::request r = fcgi.get_request();
            r << "Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\n\r\n"
                 "<!DOCTYPE html>\n"
                 "<p>Hello, World!</p>";
        }
    }
